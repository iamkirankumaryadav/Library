### **Data Pipeline**
- Takes raw data from source (Data lake, data warehouse, database, table, cloud, on-premises, logs, excel)
- Processing: Cleaning and transformation (Remove duplicates, handle missing data, handle outliers, encode, normalize)
- Delivers it to the final destination (Data lake, data warehouse, cloud, database, table)
- Further it can be used for analysis purpose (Any analytics or BI tool)

**Benefits:**
- **Efficiency:** Automate the data flow, saving time, and reducing manual efforts.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure data consistency, reduce error and validation steps.
- **Accessibility:** Make data readily available for applications, analytics, and BI tools.
- **Scalability:** Handle large and growing volumes of data.

### **Data Lake**
- A central repository that holds vast amount of raw data in its original format, from structured to unstructured data.

**Types of data stored in data lake**
- **Structured data:** Traditional databases, spreadsheets.
- **Semi-structured data:** JSON, website logs, sensor readings.
- **Unstructured data:** Emails, documents, social media feeds, and images.

**Why use data lake?**
- **Flexibility:** Data lakes store everything
- **Scalability:** Handle massive amount of data, ideal for big data applications.
- **Cost-effective:** Storing raw data is cheaper as compared to storing processed data.
- **Unleashing potentials:** A goldmine for data scientists and analysts (Explore trends, identify patterns, develop new insights)

**Use cases:**
- Retail: Customer purchase history across different channels (Retail store, online store) Understand buying behavior and recommend products.
- Finance: Track market trends, analyze customer sentiments, identify potential frauds, and transaction logs.
- Healthcare: Analyze patient data, medical records, research data, and discover new disease pattern.
- Entertainment: Analyze user behaviour on streaming platforms, social media, TV shows, content recommendations based on user preferences.

**Blind spot:**
- Data management: Challenging to find and organize the actual data.
- Data quality: Raw data might have errors or inconsistencies.
- Security: Safeguarding sensitive data within a data lake requires proper security measures.

### **Data Warehouse**
- An organized storehouse for all your company's historical data.
- Data warehouse focuses on structured data specifically chosen for analysis.
- Data source: Well defined source for specific purpose, subject oriented (sales, customers, products, employees)
- Integrated: Information from different sources is brought and presented.
- Summarized: Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.
- Categorized: Category, sub-category, etc.
- Demography: Region, country, state, territory, district, city, and zip-code.
- Access: Business analyst, data scientists, data analysts, stakeholders to eaily answer questions (querying, analysis, and reporting)
- Time-variant: Historical data over time, allowing to capture trends, patterns, and seasonality.

**Advantage:**
- **Improved decision-making:** Easier access to historical data empowers better-informed business decisions.
- **Faster analysis:** Structured and organized data allows for quicker retrieval and analysis.
- **Data consistency:** Ensures everyone in the organization works with the same set of data.
- **Reduced workload:** Frees up operational databases from complex analytical queries.
