### **Schema** 
- A schema as a blueprint for organizing data. It defines the structure of your data, including:
- What data types will be stored (text, numbers, dates, etc.)
- Relationships between different data points (like how a book title relates to its author)

### **Database**  
- The collection of data organized according to one or more schema.
- Just like a library can have different sections (fiction, non-fiction), a database can have multiple schemas for different types of data.

### **Table**  
- Within a schema, data is stored in tables. Think of a table like a bookshelf in the library.
- It holds information following a specific format defined by the schema.
- A table has rows and columns:
- Rows: These represent individual entries or records in your data. 
- Columns: These represent the different names, attributes or characteristics of each record.

**Batch processing** and **stream processing** are two fundamental approaches for handling data. They differ in how they deal with the flow and processing of information. Here's a breakdown:

### **Batch Processing:**

* **Data in Chunks:** Batch processing works with data in predefined sets or batches.
* Data is collected over some time and then processed all at once.

**Examples:**  
* Payroll processing (weekly or monthly)
* Generating reports at the end of a business day
* Training machine learning models on historical data dumps

**Pros:**
* Efficient for large datasets: Well-suited for processing big volumes of data efficiently.
* Simpler to implement: The logic and steps involved are typically straightforward.
* Reliable: Easier to handle errors and ensure data consistency within a batch.

**Cons:**
* Latency: There's a delay between data generation and processing, leading to outdated insights for real-time needs.
* Resource intensive: Processing large batches can require significant computing power at specific times.
