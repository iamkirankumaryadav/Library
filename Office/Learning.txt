# Supervised 
- Labeled Data is used to Train An Algorithm and Create a Model.
- Determine the Liklihood of A Future Event, Based on Past Occurrences of An Event.

### Types :
- Classification : Predict Category of Variable.
- Regression : Predict Numerical Values.

### Real World Applications 
- Predict whether Customer will Click on the AD.
- Weather Forecast : Machine will be Fed with the Condition Responsible for Rainfall and can Predict Probability of Raining.

# Unsupervised 
- Hidden Patterns are Uncovered from Unlabelled Data Sets.
- Grouped According to Similarities.

### Algorithm :
- Clustering Algorithm : Determine Hidden Patterns and Relationship. 
                         Learning Structure of the Unlabelled Data. 
                         Extracting Useful Information.
			 Grouping Similar Data.	
                         Split Data Points into Clusters with Similar Features.


- Anomaly Detection : Find  Outliers in a Collection of Data Points.
                      Determine Correlated Data Points in Order to Make Business Based Decisions.

### Real World Applications 
- Movie Recommendation : Unlabelled Data is Fed to Algorithm
                         Algorithm tries to Group the Data based on given Parameters (Genre, Producer, Duration)
                         Target Different Types of Users based on their Interests.

- Detecting Fraudelent Transactions : Anomaly Detection is used to Detect Unusual Behaviour.

# Pandas
- Data Manipulation and Data Analysis.
- Allow us to Read Data (CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, etc.)
- Combining, Grouping and Filtering Data 
- Time Series Functionality.

By Default Pandas joint() performs left join.
join() works best when we Join Data Frames on their Indexes.


By Default Pandas merge() performs inner() join.

By Default Pandas concat() performs Concatenation on Axis = 1

### Real Time Applications of String in Python

1. Natural Language Processing
2. Regular Expression
3. Data Mining
4. Dictionaries
5. Chatbot
6. Machine Translation

strip() :  Trim Whitespaces from String Object.

Mutable Objects: list, dict, set, byte array

Immutable Objects: int, float, complex, string, tuple, frozen set, bytes

# Matplotlib
- Visualization Helps us to Find Hidden Patterns which are not Visible
  in Tabular or Structured Data Format.

- Visualization helps to Understand the Distribution of Data.

Line | Multi Line : When both x and y is Continuous Numeric Data.

Scatter : Relationship between Numeric(Discrete | Continuous) Data Points. 

Bar | Multi Bar : When One is Categorical and One is Numeric.

Histogram : Distribution of Data | Another Axis is Frequency.

Pie : Categorical Data + Distribution | Total of Various Numerical Data

Subplots : Multiple Plots in One Plot

# Specialization 

Top Down Approach : High Level Entity is Divided into Multiple Specialized Low level Entity.
(Find Sunsets of the Entity)

# Generalization

Bottom Up Approach : Low Level Entity is Combined to Form Single High Level Entity.
(Find Common Attributes among Entities.)

# Abstraction 
- Hide Background Details or Unnecessary Information about Data from Users, so the Users will See Only Required Information.

# Encapsulation 
- Wrapping Variables and Methods into Single Entity.
- Restrictions on Accessing Variables and Methods Directly.
- Prevent Accidental or Unauthorized Modification of Data.

# Inheritance 
- Derive a New Class from the Existing Class.
- Reuse Methods and Declarations of Existing Class.

A. Single : Class B is Son of Class A | Subclass Belongs to Superclass

B. MultiLevel : Class C is Son of Class B and Class B is Son of Class A
                Subclass Belongs to other Subclass which Further belongs to A Superclass.

C. Hierarchical : Class B and Class C are Sons of Class A
	          Muliple Subclasses belongs to One Superclass.

# Polymorphism 
- Ability of An Object | Variables | Functions to take Multiple Forms.
- Single Variable | Object Name can be used to Store Variables of Multiple Data Types (float, int, long, double.)
