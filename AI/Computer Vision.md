# Open Computer Vision

- How Computers See and Gain **High Level Understanding** from `Digital Images` or `Videos`.
- Works on Pattern Recognition.
- Understand and Automate the Task of Human Visual System.
- Detecting and `Image` | `Object`, Labeling them has Surpassed Humans.
- Faster than Human Reaction and 99% Accuracy.
- High Amount of Visual Data (Images and Videos) with Processing Capabilities.

### Image Processing
- **Extract Infromation** from Image | Detailed Image Analysis.
- **Enhance** the Image | Change Color, Clearity, Size of Image.
- Computers Visualize Images as a **Matrix** containing Numbers from 0 to 255
- Each Pixel in Color have Color Information composed of  `3 Channels` **R G and B**
- **Matrix** is associated with each Channel
- Each Element of Matrix represents the **Intensity** of an Image
- Each Channel need **8 Bits** for Storage therefor it become **24 Bits** for each Pixel.

### Images are converted to and from **NumPy** Array

### Storage Requirements

1. Binary : `1 Bit` Per Pixel
2. Black and White : `8 Bits` Per Pixel | `1 Channel`
3. Grayscale : `8 Bits` Per Pixel | `1 Channel`
4. Color : `24 Bits` Per Pixel | `3 Channels`

### Pixel
- Basic **Fundamental Unit** of Image 
- Multiple Pixels arranged in **Rows** and **Columns** forms an **Image**
- Binary, Black and White, Grayscale, RGB Color Image

> Black and White and Greyscale Images are **Different**
- Black and White is only Composed with Black or White
- Grayscale is combination of Different Grades of Black and White.

### **Binary** need `1 Bit Per Pixel` for Storage and **Black** and **White** needs `8 Bits Per Pixel` for **Storage**.
- Black and White will be **Dense** and shall render **Better Quality**.

### Applications 
1. `Autonomous` | 🚗 Self Driving Cars ( Detect Objects and Humans infront of Car, Reverse Parking )
2. Facial Recognition 👦🏻🧒🏻 ( Attendance, FB Friend Recognition )
3. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality 
4. Health Care ( X Ray and MRI Scan )
5. Video Motion Analysis ( Detect Face, Object in Video )
6. Image Segmentation ( Camera Detects the Multiple Faces in a Group Selfie )
7. Scene Reconstruction ( 3D Model Creation in Architecture )
8. Image Restoration ( Filtering Blur Images and Removing Noise )
9. Search By Image `Image.Google`
10. Robotics.
