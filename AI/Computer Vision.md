# Computer Vision

- How computers see and gain **high level understanding** from `digital images` or `videos`
- Works on **pattern recognition** and **pattern recognition**
- Understand and `automate` the task of human visual system.
- Detecting an `Image` | `Object`, Labeling them has surpassed humans.
- `Faster` than human reaction and `99%` accuracy.
- High amount of Visual Data ( `Images` and `Videos` ) with high processing capabilities.

### How computer sees an image ?
- `0's` and `1's`
- Pixels are **basic fundamental unit** of image.
- Multiple pixels arranged in `matrix` ( `Rows` and `Columns` ) forms an **image**.
- Each pixels have `3 Channels` ( R [255,0,0] | G [0,255,0] | B [0,0,255] ) 8 Bits each.
- Number between `0` to `255` repre`sents `Intensity` of Color.
- Binary : 0 or 1 ( 1 **Bit** )
- Black and White ( `Single` Channel | 8 Bits )
- Grayscale ( `Single` Channel | 8 Bits )
- RGB Color Image ( `3` Channels | `24` Bits | 8 Bits each Channel )

### Image Processing

- Processing `Raw` Images and Applying **Transformation**.
- **Extract Infromation** from Image | Detailed Image Analysis.
- **Enhance** | **Improve** the Image | Change `Color`, `Clearity`, `Size` of Image, `Noise` Reduction, `Contrast`, `Rotation`.
- Prepare Image as an `Input` for a Specific Task.
- Images are converted `to` and `from` **NumPy** Array

> `Black` / `White` and `Greyscale` Images are **Different**
- `Black` and `White` is only Composed with either `Black` ( 000 ) or `White` ( fff )
- `Grayscale` is combination of different `Shades` of `Black` and `White`.
- **Binary** need `1 Bit Per Pixel` for Storage and **Black** and **White** needs `8 Bits Per Pixel` for **Storage**.
- `Black` and `White` will be **Dense** and shall render **Better Quality**.

### Machine Vision

- Image based **Automatic Inspection**, **Object + Pattern Recognition** and **Electromic Component Analysis** ( Industrial Applications ) 
- Capability of Computer to `Perceive` Environment by using Multiple Digital Cameras + Sensors from  Different Locations.
- Cameras with Advance Capability to Electromagnetic Wavelengths + Infrared + Ultraviolet or X Ray.
