# Computer Vision

- How computers gain **high level understanding** from a `digital image` or `video`
- Works on `pattern recognition`
- Understand and `automate` the task of human visual system.
- Detecting an `image` or `object`, labeling them has surpassed humans.
- `Faster` than human reaction with `99%` accuracy.
- High amount of visual data, i.e. `images` and `videos` with high processing capabilities.

### How computer sees an image ?
- `0's` and `1's`
- `Pixel` is a **basic fundamental unit** of an image.
- Multiple pixels arranged in `matrix`, i.e. `rows` and `columns` forms an **image**.
- Each pixels have `3 Channels` | `R[255,0,0]`, `G[0,255,0]`, `B[0,0,255]` | `8 bits` each.
- Number between `0` to `255` represents `intensity` of color.

### `Types` of Images 

- `Binary` : `0` or `1` | `1 bit`
- `Black` n `white` : `Single` channel | `8 bits`
- `Grayscale` : `Single` channel | `8 bits`
- `RGB` color image : `3` channels | `24 bits` | `8 bits` each channel.
- `Black` n `White` and `greyscale` images are `different`
- `Black` n `white` is only composed with completely either black : `000` or white : `fff`
- `Grayscale` is combination of different `shades` of `black` and `white`
- **Binary** need `1 bit per pixel` for storage and **black** n **white** needs `8 bits per pixel` for **storage**.
- `Black` n `white` will be **dense** and shall render **better quality**.

### Image Processing

- `Processing` raw images and applying `transformation`
- `Extract` infromation from image | Detailed image analysis.
- `Enhance` : **Improve** the image quality and appearance. 
- Change `color`, `clarity`, `size` of image, `noise` reduction, `contrast`, `rotation`
- Prepare image as an `input` for a specific task.
- Images are converted to and from `NumPy array`

### Machine Vision

- Image based **automatic inspection** (Airports and malls entry gate)
- **Object + pattern recognition**. 
- **Electromic Component Analysis** ( Industrial Applications ) 
- Capability of computer to `perceive` environment by using multiple digital cameras + sensors from multiple locations.
- Cameras with advance capturing capabilities : Electromagnetic Wavelengths + Infrared + Ultraviolet or X Ray.

9. Search By Image [`Image.Google`](https://images.google.com/) üñº
10. Robotics ü§ñ

### Important Terms
