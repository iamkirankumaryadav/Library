# Computer Vision
- Think of computer vision as teaching a computer to "see" and understand the world like a human does.
- It's a field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos.

### Simple Example: Facial Recognition
- One of the most common applications of computer vision is facial recognition. Let's break down how it works:

1. **Image Capture:** A camera takes a picture of a person's face.
2. **Feature Extraction:** The computer analyzes the image, looking for specific features like the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose, and the contour of the lips.
3. **Comparison:** The extracted features are compared to a database of known faces.
4. **Identification:** If a match is found, the computer identifies the person in the image.

### Real-world Applications
- **Security:** Facial recognition is used in airports and other secure locations for identification and access control.
- **Social Media:** Apps like Facebook use facial recognition to suggest tagging friends in photos.
- **Self-driving Cars:** Cars use computer vision to detect pedestrians, other vehicles, and traffic signs.
- **Medical Imaging:** Doctors use computer vision to analyze X-rays, MRIs, and other medical images to detect abnormalities.
- Detecting an image or object and labelling them has surpassed humans. Faster than human reaction with 99% accuracy.
- High amount of visual data, i.e. images and videos with high processing capabilities.

### How computer see an image?
- 0's and 1's. Pixel is a **basic fundamental unit** of an image.
- Multiple pixels arranged in a matrix, i.e. rows and columns form an **image**.
- Each pixels have 3 Channels | B[255,0,0], G[0,255,0], R[0,0,255] | 8 bits each.
- Normally the order is RGB channel but OpenCV reads the image channel in order BGR.
- The number between 0 to 255 represents the intensity of colour.

### Types of Images
- Binary: 0 or 1 | 1 bit
- Black and white: Single channel | 8 bits
- Grayscale: Single channel | 8 bits
- RGB colour image: 3 channels | 24 bits (8 bits each channel)
- Black/White and greyscale images are different.
- Black/White is only composed with completely either black: 000 or white: fff.
- Grayscale is a combination of different shades of black and white.
- **Binary** need 1 bit per pixel for storage and **black** n **white** needs 8 bits per pixel for **storage**.
- Black/White will be **dense** and shall render **better quality**.

### Image Acquisition
- Techniques for capturing images using various devices like cameras, scanners, and medical imaging equipment.

### Image Processing
- **Image Filtering:** Applying filters to enhance or reduce the noise in images.
- **Image Transformation:** Manipulating images through geometric transformations.
- **Image Extraction:** Extract information from the image (Detailed image analysis)
- **Image Enhancement:** Techniques to improve the image quality and appearance. 
- Colour, clarity, size, noise reduction, contrast, rotation, sharpness, orientation, and scale.
- Prepare an image as an input for a specific task. Images are converted to and from the NumPy array

### Feature Extraction
- **Edge Detection:** Identifying boundaries between regions with different intensity levels.
- **Corner Detection:** Locating points of significant intensity change in an image.
- **Texture Analysis:** Analyzing the spatial arrangement of patterns in an image.
- **Color Analysis:** Extracting information from the colour content of an image.

### Machine Vision
- Image-based **automatic inspection** (Airports and malls entry gate)
- **Object + Pattern Recognition**. 
- **Electronic Component Analysis** (Industrial Applications) 
- Capability of the computer to perceive the environment by using multiple digital cameras + sensors from multiple locations.
- Cameras with advanced capturing capabilities: Electromagnetic Wavelengths + Infrared + Ultraviolet or X-Ray.

### Object Detection and Recognition
- **Object Detection:** Identifying the presence and location of objects in an image.
- **Object Recognition:** Classifying and categorizing detected objects.
- **Object Tracking:** Following the movement of objects over time.

### Image Segmentation
- **Partitioning:** Dividing an image into meaningful regions or segments.
- **Semantic Segmentation:** Assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image.
- **Instance Segmentation:** Identifying and segmenting individual instances of objects in an image.

8. **Scene Reconstruction** (3D model creation in architecture)
9. **Image Restoration** (Filtering blur images and removing noise)
10. Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, etc. Search by image [`Image.Google`](https://images.google.com/) üñº
