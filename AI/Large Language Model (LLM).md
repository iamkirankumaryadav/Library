# **Large Language Model (LLM)**

A type of AI program that excels at understanding and generating human language. 

1. **Function:**
* LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data, which allows them to grasp the language and perform various tasks related to NLP.
* These tasks include things like generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way.

2. **Learning:**
- They use a specific kind of neural network architecture called a transformer model.
- This model is like a super-powered learning tool that can analyze massive amounts of text data and identify patterns.
- By recognizing these patterns, the LLM learns the relationships between words and how they're used in context.

3. **Applications:**
- LLMs have a wide range of potential applications.
- They can be used in chatbots, machine translation tools, and even to create new educational materials.

- Outside of the enterprise context, it may seem like LLMs have arrived out of the blue along with new developments in generative AI.
- However, many companies have spent years implementing LLMs at different levels to enhance their natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.
- This has occurred alongside advances in machine learning, machine learning models, algorithms, neural networks and the transformer models that provide the architecture for these AI systems.

- LLMs are a class of foundation models, which are trained on enormous amounts of data to provide the foundational capabilities needed to drive multiple use cases and applications, as well as resolve a multitude of tasks. This is in stark contrast to the idea of building and training domain specific models for each of these use cases individually, which is prohibitive under many criteria (most importantly cost and infrastructure), stifles synergies and can even lead to inferior performance.

- LLMs represent a significant breakthrough in NLP and artificial intelligence, and are easily accessible to the public through interfaces like `Open AI’s Chat GPT-3` and `GPT-4`, which have garnered the support of Microsoft.
- Other examples include `Meta’s Llama` models and Google’s bidirectional encoder representations from transformers `(BERT/RoBERTa)` and `PaLM` models.
- IBM has also recently launched its Granite model series on `watsonx.ai`, which has become the generative AI backbone for other IBM products like watsonx Assistant and watsonx Orchestrate. 

- In a nutshell, LLMs are designed to understand and generate text like a human, in addition to other forms of content, based on the vast amount of data used to train them.
- They have the ability to infer from context, generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, translate to languages other than English, summarize text, answer questions (general conversation and FAQs) and even assist in creative writing or code generation tasks.
