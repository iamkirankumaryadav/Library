# **Large Language Model (LLM)**

A type of AI program that excels at understanding and generating human language. 

1. **Function:**
* LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data, which allows them to grasp the language and perform various tasks related to NLP.
* These tasks include things like generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way.

2. **Learning:**
- They use a specific neural network architecture called a transformer model.
- This model is like a super-powered learning tool that can analyze massive amounts of text data and identify patterns.
- By recognizing these patterns, the LLM learns the relationships between words and their use in context.

### **Facts:**
- Outside of the enterprise context, it may seem like LLMs have arrived unexpectedly along with new developments in generative AI.
- However, many companies have spent years implementing LLMs at different levels to enhance their natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.
- This has occurred alongside advances in machine learning, machine learning models, algorithms, neural networks and the transformer models that provide the architecture for these AI systems.
- LLMs are a class of foundation models, which are trained on enormous amounts of data to provide the foundational capabilities needed to drive multiple use cases and applications and resolve many tasks. The idea of building and training domain-specific models for each of these use cases individually is prohibitive under many criteria (most importantly cost and infrastructure)
- LLMs represent a significant discovery in NLP and AI and are easily accessible to the public through interfaces like `Open AI’s Chat GPT-3` and `GPT-4`, which have garnered the support of Microsoft.
- Other examples include `Meta’s Llama` models and Google’s bidirectional encoder representations from transformers `(BERT/RoBERTa)` and `PaLM` models. 
- They have the ability to understand from context, generate readable and contextually relevant responses, translate to languages other than English, summarize text, answer questions (general conversation and FAQs) and even assist in creative writing or code generation tasks.
