# Data Visualization

- New data is generated every second, data is `collected` and `stored`, `charts`, `graphs` and `tables` add meaning to data.
- Data begins to tell some story, data is illustrated using visualization.
- `Matplotlib` : Most widely used Python data visualization library and 3rd party library.
- `Seaborn` : Generate `informative statistical graphics`, it is dependent on `matplotlib`
- `Bokeh` : Generate interactive plots, accessed as `JSON`, `HTML` objects or interactive web applications.

### Purpose of Visualization
- Make `Comparison` ( Magnitudes )
- Ask lots of questions to data, chart selection, design and labels.
- We should keep `cause` on `X Axis` and it's `effect` on `Y Axis`
- Always keep `magnitude` related to `height` or `frequency` in vertical position.
- Always put `time` on `X Axis`

### 1. Bar Chart | Column Chart ( Comparison )
- Data **Comparison** ( Categorical Features : Nominal | Ordinal )
- Can be used for **Categorical** as well as **Numeric Data**
- Change over a Period of Time | Compare Magnitude | Ranking | Length ( Height, Width, Distance )
- Represented **Vertically** or **Horizontally** or **Grouped** ( If we want to Measure more than One Variable )
- `Similar` Charts : **Lolipop** Chart ( Bubble at Top | Can be used if Number of `Bars` are more in **Bar** Chart )

### 2. Histogram
- **Distribution** of Data | **Frequency | Occurence** of **Continuous** Data
- Comparing Two **Entities**
- **Bins** : **Range of Values** divided into **Series of Intervals**

### 3. Scatter 
- Determine the **Relationship** between **Dependent** and **Independent** Variables
- Value of One Variable | Feature determines the position on the **Horizontal Axis** ( **X Axis** )
- Value of One Variable | Feature determines the position on the **Vertical Axis** ( **Y Axis** )

### 4. Area | Stack | Streamgraph
- Tracking the **Changes** over time
- Useful to Represent **Time Series Relation**

### 5. Pie  | Doughnut ( Proportion )
- A Circular Graph divided into **Segments** or **Slices**.
- Represent **Percentage** or **Proportion** Data where each **Slice** of Pie represents **Category**.

### 6. Boxplot
- Represent `Outliers` and `Distribution` of Data.

### 7. Line | Sparkline ( Overview | Without Units and Labels )
- Change over `Time` | Trends | Profits | Loss | Increase | Decrease | Flow
- Univariate and Multivariate.
