# Predictive Analytics

`CISP - DM` : Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining.
- Widely used method for planning the data science projects.

## Stages 

### 1. **Business Understanding** 
- Understand the **problem** you are trying to **solve**.
- Define your goal.

`e.g.` 

- What will be the number of sales of a product in the next quarter ?
- What is the average number of days a used car stays on the market in bangalore.

### 2. **Data Understanding** 
- **Learn** and **communicate** from available data and **data Types**, get familiar with data.
- Understand the types of data, in order to process it for predictions.
- Collect the right `quality` and `quantity` of data.

### 3. **Data Preparation** : 
- **Prepare** the data for the model so that it can `train` the model with better accuracy. 
- Handle **missing** values.
- Handle **outliers**.
- Encode **categorical data**.
- Apply **normalization** or **standardization**. 

### 5. **Data Modeling** 
- **Split** the data into **train**, **validate** and **test** set, 
- Train the model and make **predictions**. ( Iterative )

### 6. **Data Evaluation** 
- **Validate** the model performance, **improve** model performance by tuning **hyperparamters**. ( Iterative )
- Data modeling and evaluation are the important stages for assurance that model is accurate.

### 7. **Deployment** 
- After finding the **successful model**.
