# `Data Cleaning`

`Data Cleaning` is very important to prevent from encountering `Errors`

### Types of `Errors`

1. **Missing Values** : NaT, NaN, NA, None ( Data type of NaN is `float` )
2. **Bad Values** : Outlier, Value generated due to error, spelling mistakes, case mistakes ( cpu and CPU )
3. **Duplicates** : Same data
