### **Exploratory Data Analysis**

`Exploratory Data Analysis` (EDA) is a process of analyzing data sets to **summarize** their main **characteristics**, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

1. EDA is an essential step in a data science project, and data scientists spend almost 70% of their work doing EDA of their dataset
2. The goal of EDA is to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations
3. EDA is an iterative cycle that involves generating questions about the data, searching for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modeling the data, and using what is learned to refine or generate new questions
4. EDA can be divided into two types: graphical analysis and non-graphical analysis. In graphical analysis, visualizations and charts are used to visualize trends and patterns in the data, while in non-graphical analysis, statistical tools like mean, median, or mode are used to analyze the data
5. EDA helps to prepare the dataset for analysis, allows a machine learning model to predict the dataset better, gives more accurate results, and helps to choose a better machine learning model
6. EDA is a creative process, and the key to asking quality questions is to generate a large quantity of questions. It is difficult to ask revealing questions at the start of the analysis because the insights contained in the dataset are not yet known
