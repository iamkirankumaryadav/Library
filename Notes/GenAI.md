Generative AI

- Prompt Template: Persona, Context, Task, Example, Format, Constraints, Rules, Tone
- Agents: AI systems that can interact with their environment, learn from experience and perform tasks autonomously.
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): A hypothetical AI which is more powerful than the current capabilities, human like intelligence, going beyond training.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): A DL architecture, that trains two NN to compete against each other to improve and generate more authentic new data.
- Variational Autoencoder (VAEs): A generative model that uses DL to learn a probabilistic representation of data and generates new data  sample.
- Conversational AI: AI that enables computers to communicate and interact with humans in a natural language, such as text or voice.
- Generator: The generator's job is to create new data (like images of faces) that resemble the real data from the training dataset.
- Discriminator: The discriminator's job is to analyze the data (both real and generated) and determine if it's realistic or fake.
- Autoencoder: A type of ANN for unsupervised learning tasks like dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection for more generative models. (Encoder | Decoder)
- Encoder: It takes the input data and compresses it into a smaller representation, capturing the essential features.
- Decoder: It takes the compressed representation from the encoder (the sketch) and expands it back into a format similar to the original data.
- Generative Pre-trained Transformers: Leverages LLMs to allow users have human like interactions, conversations, creations, exploration.
- Embeddings: A technique used to present complex data, text, image as a neumerical vectors. These vectors captures the semantic or contextual relationships.
- Few Shot Learning: A concept where model is designed to learn and make predictions or decisions based on a very limited amount of training data. (J&J Chatbot)
- Zero Shot Learning: A concept where an AI model learns to perform tasks that it has not explicitly been trained to do. (Unicorn)
- Generative AI: AI systems that can generate new content uch as texts, images, audio, and video in response to prompts by a user.
- Inference: The process where a trained AI model applies its learned knowledge to new, unseen data to make predictions, decisions, or generate content.
- Large Language Model: AI systems specifically designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language on a large scale.
- Autoregressive Model (AR) models are statistical models that predict a variable's future value based on its past values.
- Transformers: A specific type of neural network architecture that has revolutionized how machines process and generate text.
- Neural Networks: Inspired by the human brain, they are complex algorithms that learn from vast amounts of data.Artificial Neural Network (ANN) consist of layers of interconnected nodes, where each node processes information and passes it to the next layer (Regression/Classification)
- Deep Neural Network (DNN): ANN with multiple hidden layers, capable of learning more complex patterns.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Specifically designed for extracting information and processing grid-like data, such as images and videos.
- In CNN, Pooling Layers reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps while preserving important information.
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Designed to process sequential data, such as text, time series, and audio.Prompt Engineering: Prompt engineering refers to the crafting of input prompts to effectively guide AI models in producing specific and desired outputs.
- Retrieval Augmented Generation: The LLM analyzes your input an generates a query to search the information retrieval system.
- Semantic Networks: A knowledge representation method used in AI to model relationships between concepts.
- Multimodal AI: An AI that can process information from multiple sources, of multiple data types (Text, image, video, and audio)\(RLHF) Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback: A technique that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with human input to train AI models.
- Multimodal Decision Intelligence (MDI): A comprehensive framework that combines various data modalities (Text, images, audio, video) to make informed decisions.
- Intelligent Decision Automation (IDA): A technological approach that leverages AI and ML to automate decision-making processes.
- Explainable AI (XAI): A subfield of AI that focuses on making ML models more transparent and understandable.
- Positional Encoding: A technique used in ML models, particularly transformers, to address the order of elements within a sequence.
- Temperature: A parameter that controls the randomness or creativity in a modelâ€˜s responses.
- Knowledge Graph: A semantic network that represents knowledge as a graph of interconnected entities and their relationships.
