Historical Forecasting Model: Predict Future by analyzing past.
- The basic  idea was to gather historical data, identify trends and patterns, and project the trends.
- Calculating moving averages (Average of most recent data points)
- Exponential Smoothing (Similar to SMA, but assigning high weightage to the most recent data points)
- Accuarcy depends on the quantity and quality of historical data. Limited data can lead to unreliable forecasts.

ARIMA(p, d, q)
- Core assumption is data is stationary (Data points are collected at regular intervals over time)
- Autoregression (AR | p): Captures the influence of past data on future forecast.
- Integration (I | d): Degree of differencing (Make data stationary: Subtracting previous value with the current value in the series)
- Moving Average (MA | q): The effect of past forecast error on the current prediction (Average of the errors)

SARIMA (p. d. q)(P, D, Q)s Focus Seasonality: Recurring Patterns
- SAR: Capture the influence of past seasonal data on current forecast.

- I: Removes seasonal trends.
- The effect of past seasonal forecast error on the current prediction
- Seasonal Period (s): 12 for monthly, 4 for quarterly, 7 for weekly.
