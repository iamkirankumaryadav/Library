- Columns - Feature Matrix ( Variables ) and Target Vector ( Labels )
- Features - Independent Variable | Dimensions | Attributes | Inputs | Predictors | Estimators | Characteristics.
- Target - Dependent Variable | Label | Class | Output | Predicted Value | Estimated Value | Response.
- Rows | Observations | Records | Samples | Instance.
- `Feature` :  A **measurable** property, can be categorical ( discrete ) or numerical ( real or int number )
- `Target` : What we want to make **prediction** for.
- `Model` learns a relationship between a `feature matrix` and a `target vector`
- `Model` is the system that makes **predictions** or **classification** on new unseen data.
- `Goal` of machine learning is to build a model that performs well on new data.
- **Parameters** are factors which are considered by the model to make **predictions** or **classification**.
- **Parameters** are tuned to gain **accuracy** with least [**error**](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Library/blob/main/Data%20Science/Error.md).

### Scikit Learn

1. Scikit learn is a great library for creating `machine learning model` from data.
2. Before you `fit` a model using scikit learn, you data has to be in a recognizable format.
3. Scikit learn works well with `numeric` data that is stored in `NumPy arrays`
4. It can also convert data from objects like `Pandas : dataframes` and `NumPy : arrays`
5. `Feature matrix` is a `2D` grid of data where `rows` represents `samples` and `columns` represents `features`     
6. `Target vector` is usually `1D` vector `column`

<h1 name='sup' align=center>Supervised Learning ( Labeled Data )</h1>

- `Machine Learning` that involves training a model using `labeled` data.
- Algorithm learns to recognize `patterns` in the input data and map them to the correct output based on the labeled data.
- Goal of supervised learning is to create a model that can accurately predict the output for new, unseen input data.
- Supervised learning is useful for `classification` and `regression` problems.

<h3 name='linreg'>1. Linear Regression</h3>  

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/02.Linear%20Regression.ipynb)

![Equation of Line](Image/EquationLine.png)

- Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two continuous variables.
- Linear regression is used when there is a linear relationship between the two variables.
- The relationship can be described by a straight line, it uses existing data to train the model.

<h1 name='class' align=center>Classification</h1>

<h3 name='logreg'>2. Logistic Regression (<a href='https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Library/blob/main/Data%20Science/Supervised%20Learning/Classification/Logistic%20Regression.md'>More</a> )</h3>

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/04.Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

- Model used for `classification` tasks like classifying flower species and image recognition.
- One or more independent features is used to **classify** `categorical` target labels. 
- Dependent ( Output ) should be `categorical` ( 0 or 1 )
- `Probability` of finite number of outcomes or occurence.

### Advantages of Logistic Regression

- Model `training` and `predictions` are relatively fast, no tuning is usually required.
- Performs well with small number of observations or samples.

### Logistic Regression for Multiclass Classification

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/05.Logistic%20Regression%20for%20Multiclass%20Classification.ipynb)

- Split the task into multiple binary classification dataset.
- **Fit** a binary classification ( Logistic Regression ) model on each.
- One vs Rest (`OvR`) or One vs All (`OvA`) is a technique that extends binary classification to **multiclass**.
- Digit `0` vs Digit `1`, `2` and `3`
- Digit `1` vs Digit `0`, `2` and `3`
- Digit `2` vs Digit `0`, `1` and `3`
- Digit `3` vs Digit `0`, `1` and `2`
- Model that predicts the **higest** class probability is the predicted class.
  
<h3 name='tree'>3. Decision Tree</h3>

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/06.Decision%20Tree.ipynb)

- A very interpretable machine learning algorithm.
- `Root Node` : `Decisions` | `Conditions` | `Outcomes`
- `Edges` : `Branches` | `Splits`
- `Leaf Node` : `Terminal` | `Label` | `Class`
- We select the feature as `Node` that **splits** the data very well.
- Attribute with `High Information Gain` or `Low Entropy` or `Low Gini Index` is selected as `best attribute` to split.
- Used especially for `binary` classification and `multiclass` classification and even used for `Regression`
- Models where the `target` variable takes a `categorical` set of values are `classification` tree.
- Models where the `target` variable takes a `continuous` values are `regression` Tree.
- `CART` : **C**lassification **A**nd **R**egression **T**ree.
- Growing a tree means deciding which **Feature** to choose ? and what condition to use ? for splitting.
- `Continuous` can be converted into `binary` or `boolean` by setting `threshold` value.
- We should also know when to `stop` | `terminate` ( **Max Depth** ) to prevent from `overfitting`
- Decision tree can be `pruned` if necessary to avoid `overfitting` 

### `Information Gain` ( Which Feature will be selected as Root Node ? )

- `High Information Gain` is better ( Explains the split very well )
- `Information Gain` decides which feature will become `Node` and will `split` the data further for building the **tree**.
- Split with the `High Information Gain` will be considered as first split and the process will continue untill **IG** becomes 0.

### `Gini Index` ( Checks for `Impurity` in the dataset )

- `Low Gini Index` is better.
- `Pure` : All data belongs to `same` class in a subset ( Gini Index = 0 )
- `Impure` : Data is mixture of `different` classes in a subset.

### `Entrophy` ( Measure Disorder | Randomness | Uncertainity in Data )

- `Low Entrophy` is better. ( Easy to draw conclusion from data )
- `High Entrophy` ( Hard to draw conclusion from data )

Advantage of Decision Tree | Disadvantage of Decision Tree
:--- | :---
Handle `categorical` and `numerical` data | Prone to `overfitting`
No effect of `outliers` | Need carefull **parameter tuning**
Handle **non linear data** |

### Individual trees are prone to `overfitting` but improves when `ensembled`

### How to Avoid Overfitting ?
- Remove | `Prune` branches with less importance ( Irrelevant Feature )
- Early stop ( Limit the `Max Depth` of the tree )

<h3 name='forest'>4. Random Forests ( Ensemble Learning Technique | Bagging )</h3>

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/09.Random%20Forest.ipynb)

- An ensemble learning method used for both `regression` and `classification`
- A collection of decision trees, where each decision tree is built using a random subset of the training data ( feature matrix )
- Multiple `decision trees` ( weak learners ) are trained `parallely` and `individually` | `independently`
- `Bootstrapping` ( Row sampling with replacement ) : Subsets are randomly selected from the original dataset.
- `Majority Voting` : `Prediction` of model is based on the **voting** of decision trees outputs.
- `Regression`: The mean prediction of the individual decision trees is considered.
- `Classification` : The class selected by most of the decision trees are considered.
- Random forest creates a model that is more accurate and less prone to overfitting than a single decision tree.
- `Bagging` : Multiple decision trees are trained in `parallel` to form one strong accurate predicting model.
- Adding multiple decision trees reduces the risk of `error` and `overfitting` by reducing the variance. 

<h3 name='svm'>5. Support Vector Machine | SVM</h3>

- Support Vector Machine is used for both `regression` and `classification`
- Finds an optimal `line` or `hyperplane` that separates the 2 distinct classes with `maximum margin` in `N dimensional space`
- `Hyperplanes` are decision boundaries that help to `classify` the data points. Data points are called `Support Vectors`
- `SVM` can be used for `linear` and `non linear` regression and classification.
- `SVM` can manage high dimensional data and nonlinear relationships between the data points.
- `SVM` uses `kernel trick` for `non linear` data which creates a `hyperplane` in `N dimensional space` for linear seperation.
- Works better even if data set has lot of `outliers` ( Because SVM focus only on `support vectors` closest to the line  )
- Take long time to `train` and `predict` if the number of `observations` are very large.
- Kernel functions : Linear | Radial basis function ( RBF ) | Polynomial | Exponential.

### Benefits 

- SVM works well with `unstructured` and `semi structured` data ( text, image, face, anomaly detections, etc. )
- `Generalize` well on the new unseen data and risk of `overfitting` is also less.

### Disadvantage

- Choosing a `good Kernel` function, `fine tuning` and even `visualization` is challenging.
- Difficult to understand the `final model`, variable `weights` have individual impact.

<h3 name='knn'>6. K Nearest Neighbours</h3>

- `KNN` is used for both `regression` and `classification`
- `KNN` measures the `geometrical distance` ( euclidean distance ) 
- Initialize `K` ( `# nearest neigbors` ) 
- Calculate distance between new data points and `K nearest neigbours` of training data points.
- Sort the calculated distance in `ascending` order and get `shortest` distance or `most frequent` classes in neighbor.
- `Regression` : `Mean` of K nearest distances are considered.
- `Classification` : `Mode` of K nearest distances are considered.

<h3 name='naive'>7. Naive Bayes</h3>

- Naive Bayes is a `probabilistic classifier`, based on `Class Prediction Probability` ( `Binary` and `Multiclass` classification )
- Creates the `conditional probability distribution` for all the classes independently.
- `Naive` : Assumes that all of the `features` are `independent` from each other ( No correlation between any feature )
- e.g `Classification` of Dogs Breed ( Naive Bayes tries to create a `probability` that each Dog belongs to seperate `Class` )
- `Weights` can be added to improve `accuracy`

> P( **A** | **B** ) = P( **B** | **A** ) / P( **B** )

All follow same process in **Regression** and **Classification** the only difference is in **Output**. 

> **Regression** : **Continuous Numerical**

> **Classification**  : **Categorical**

</table>

- Find `patterns` and `relationships` between **feature matrix**.
- Extract important features and explore the dataset in detail.
- Unsupervised algorithms don't make **predictions** from the data.
 
 <h1 name='cluster' align=center>Clustering</h1>

- Find some underlying `pattern` and `structure` in data.
- Groups the data set into **segments** or **clusters** based on **similarity**.
- Customer Segmentation | Fraud Detection | Document Classification

### Clustering Techniques

<h3 name='kmean'>1. K Mean Clustering</h3>

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/10.K%20Mean%20Clustering.ipynb)

- Cluster data points with similar characteristics in one cluster.
- We choose **K** number of clusters.
- Select **K** random data points as `centroid`
- Data points nearest to its corresponding `centroid` belongs to that **cluster**.
- Again the `centroid` is calculated, the data points are updated based on new `centroid`
- **Iterative** Process | Stops when there is no further classification.
- Different starting points ( Random centroid selected ) Create different clusters. 
- **Elbow** Method : Sum of squared distance get smaller as the number of clusters increases.  
- `Elbow` method helps to find **optimal** number of clusters.

<h3 name='hc'>2. Hierarchical Clustering</h3>

A. Agglomerative
- Bottom Up Approach
- **AGNES** ( **Ag**glomerative **Nes**ting )
- Each Data Point is considered as an Individual Cluster
- At each Iteration, Similar Clusters merge with other Clusters until One Single Cluster remains.

B. Divisive
- Top Down Approach
- **DIANA** ( **Di**vise **Ana**lysis )
- Dividing the Single Cluster into n Clusters

### How we Calculate Similarity between the Clusters
- **MIN** ( Distance between the Closest Points of Two Clusters )
- **MAX** ( Distance between the Farthest Points of Two Clusters )
- Group **AVG** ( Average of Distance between Each Data Points of Two Clusters )
- Distance between **Centroids** ( Distance between the Centroid of Two Clusters )
 
<h3 name="dbscan"> 3. Density Based Clustering </h3>

- `DBSCAN` ( Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with **Noise** )
- Group similar data points together based on density.
- High Density Region : Points are `close` to each other | High neighbours within the radius.
- Data points which are in `low density` regions are `outliers`.
- Clustering methods explains better with visualization. e.g. Scatter Plot.
- Relationships between features can be represented via clustering.

### B. Dimensionality Reduction

- A technique used to reduce the number of `features` or `variables` in a dataset while retaining the most important information.
- Aim is to find the **important features | variables** that can be used by model for better predition.
- Reducing **irrelevant features** that has no relation with the target feature.
- There are some features that brings `Multicollinearity`
- **Feature Elimination** | **Feature Selection** or **Feature Extraction**
- Save storage and time by improving performance of model.
- Due to less number of features it can be visualized in `2D` and `3D`.
- Project data into lower dimension while preserving as much as useful variability ( 19/20 ) as possible.
- e.g If we observe a `Scatter Plot` in multidimension it will be complicated for understanding. 
- Consider only 1D then it is just a line and few Points in which some are close to line and some are bit far away from line.
- Combine features or remove features to reduce dimensions.

### Techniques of Dimensionality Reduction

<h3 name='pca'>PCA ( Principal Component Analysis ) ( Unsupervised )</h3> 

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/11.PCA.ipynb)

- Transforms a dataset into a new set of variables without loosing information called principal components.
- PCA aims to capture the most important patterns or relationships in the data while reducing its dimensionality.
- Reduce the **dimensions** of large dataset.
- Small data sets are **easy** to **explore** and **visualize**.
- **Analyzing** and **training** is also much **easier** and **faster**.
- First principal component is the linear combination that explains the largest amount of variation in the data.
- Subsequent principal components explain decreasing amounts of variation.
- Most of the informations within the initial variables are **compressed** into **first components**.  
- PCA tries to put **maximum possible information** in **first component**. 
- And then remaining information in the corresponding **components**.
- `PCA` is effected by scale, so scaling of features before applying `PCA` is important.
- Reconstruct the original data from the reduced dimensional representation by using a subset of the principal components.
- This reconstruction is an approximation of the original data but captures the essential characteristics.

<h3 name='lda'>LDA ( Linear Discriminant Analysis ) ( Supervised )</h3>

- Classification | Sperate Data into Different Categories or Classes
- LDA Creates **New Axis** ( **Maximize** the **Distance** between **Means** of **Two Classes** and **Minimize Variation** within each Class )

<h3 name='tsne'>t-SNE ( t Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding )</h3>

- Non Linear Dimension Reduction ( Spiral, Mixed ) 
- Data which is Complicated for Understanding ( Multi Dimensional Data )
- A Tool to **Visualize** and **Explore** High Dimension Data.
- Identify **Clusters** based on Similarity of Data Points.
- Maps **Multi Dimensional Data** to a **Lower Dimensional Space**. 

### Anomaly Detection :
- Automatically Discover **Unusual** Data Points in Data Set.
- Used to Find Fraudulent Transactions, Identify an `Outlier` caused by Human Error during Data Entry.
- Reduces Complexity of Data and Helps to Understand Data more Clearly and Better Way.

### Association Mining :
- Set of Items that Frequently Occur together in Data Set.
- Basket Analysis : Items Bought Together | Goods Purchased at the Same Time Help to Develop Marketing Strategies.

### Feature Selection
- **Select** Important Features | Helps to Improve **Accuracy** | Not Every Feature Adds Value to Solve Problem.
- **Understanding** Each Feature before using it for Creating Machine Learning Model.
- **Correaltion** between **Features** and **Target** helps to Select Better Features.
- **Ensemble Learning Techniques** have a Parameter of **feature_importance** which helps us to find Important Features.

### Standardization 
- Standardize the **Range** of the **Continuous** Initial Variables so that each one of them contributes Equally to the **Analysis**.
