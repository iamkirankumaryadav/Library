<h3 name='linreg'>1. Linear Regression</h3>  

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/02.Linear%20Regression.ipynb)

![Equation of Line](Image/EquationLine.png)

- Linear Regression finds the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- Linear Regression finds the best fit straight line that accurately predicts the output values within a range.
- The straight line is called the regression line.
- Formula: y = mX + c, where y is the dependent variable and X is the independent variable.
- **m** is the **slope** and **c** is the **y-intercept**, both are the **regression coefficients**.
- Linear Regression is simple to understand and interpret, with fast training and prediction.
- Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between variables, sensitive to outliers.
- Can suffer from multicollinearity if the dataset has highly correlated variables.

**Hyperparameters:**

1. **Alpha:**
- Used in Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regression, determines the strength of the regularization.
- A higher value of alpha means more regularization and simpler linear models.
- For Î±lpha = 0, Ridge regression is just linear regression.
- The best value for alpha is found by cross-validation (Grid Search CV or Random Search CV)

2. **Normalization:**
- If True, the independent variable X will be normalized before regression by subtracting the **mean**.

3. **Fit Intercept:**
- Whether to calculate the intercept **c** for this model.
- If set to False, no intercept will be used in calculations.
 
<h1 name='class' align=center>Classification</h1>

<h3 name='logreg'>2. Logistic Regression (<a href='https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Library/blob/main/Data%20Science/Supervised%20Learning/Classification/Logistic%20Regression.md'>More</a> )</h3>

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/04.Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

- Model used for classification tasks like classifying flower species and image recognition.
- A statistical model used to predict the probability of a binary outcome (T/F, Y/N, 1/0, etc.)
- Logistic Regression starts with a linear equation, and the result is passed through a sigmoid function.
- The sigmoid/logistic function maps the linear combination to a probability between 0 and 1.
- If the predicted probability is greater than a threshold (0.5), the model predicts the outcome as 1.
- One or more independent features are used to **classify** categorical target labels/variables.
- Widely used for binary classification, simple and requires less training, rescaling provides better accuracy.

### Advantages of Logistic Regression

- Model training and predictions are relatively fast, no tuning is usually required.
- Performs well with a small number of observations or samples.

### Logistic Regression for Multiclass Classification

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/05.Logistic%20Regression%20for%20Multiclass%20Classification.ipynb)

- Split the task into multiple binary classification datasets.
- **Fit** a binary classification (Logistic Regression) model on each label.
- One vs Rest (OvR) or One vs All (OvA) is a technique that extends binary classification to **multiclass** classification.
- Digit 0 vs Digit 1, 2 and 3
- Digit 1 vs Digit 0, 2 and 3
- Digit 2 vs Digit 0, 1 and 3
- Digit 3 vs Digit 0, 1 and 2
- The model that predicts the **highest** class probability is the predicted class.
  
<h3 name='tree'>3. Decision Tree</h3>

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/06.Decision%20Tree.ipynb)

- Root Node: Represents the entire sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets.
- Edges | Branches | Splits | Decisions | Conditions | Outcomes | Sub Tree
- Leaf Node | Terminal | Label | Class: Nodes that do not split further.
- The **Decision Tree** recursively splits the data into smaller subsets based on the values (Continuous or Discrete) of input variables.
- At each split, the algorithm chooses the best feature to split the data into two subsets based on the values of that feature.
- The process continues until the data is split into a pure subset (A subset that can't be split further)
- Once the data is split into a pure subset, the decision tree can be used to make predictions for new data points.
- Decision Trees are used to make predictions on new data by traversing the tree, the terminal node represents the predicted outcome.
- The tree is built by selecting the best feature at each node, based on measures of impurity, such as the Gini Index or IG
- Feature with **High Information Gain** or **Low Entropy** or **Low Gini Index** is selected as the best feature.
- The path from the root to a leaf node represents a set of rules that will be used to predict or classify new instances.
- Used especially for binary classification and multiclass classification.
- When the target variable has a categorical set of values, a classification tree is used.
- When the target variable has a continuous value, a regression tree is used.
- **CART:** Classification And Regression Tree.
- Decision Tree is prone to overfitting, resulting into a poor performance on the test data.
- Pruning: When we remove unnecessary sub-nodes (features) of a decision node.
- Pruning reduces the complexity, overfitting, and improves its generalization performance.
- Growing a tree means deciding which feature to choose and what condition to apply for splitting.
- Continuous can be converted into a binary or boolean by setting the threshold value.
- We should also know when to stop | terminate (**Max Depth**) to prevent the model from overfitting.
- Decision trees can be pruned if necessary to avoid overfitting.

**Advantages:**
- Easy to visualize and understand, they can also handle missing data and outliers.
- Don't require extensive data preprocessing such as normalization or rescaling.
- Capture non-linear relationships between the feature matrix and target vector.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
```

### Information Gain (Which feature is to be selected as a root node?)
- **IG** decides which feature will become a **node** and will split the data further for building the **tree**.
- Feature with the **High IG** will be considered and the process will continue until **IG** becomes 0.

### Gini Index (Checks for impurity in the dataset)
- A low **Gini Index** is better.
- Pure: All data belongs to the same class in a subset (Gini Index = 0)
- Impure: Data is a mixture of different classes in a subset.

### Entrophy (Measure Disorder | Randomness | Uncertainty in Data | Unpredictability)
- **Low Entropy** is better. (Easy to conclude from the data)

### Cross Entropy (Classification loss function)
- The difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true probability distribution.
- **Low cross entropy:** A close match between the predicted and actual probability distribution.
- **High cross entropy:** A huge difference between the predicted and actual probability distribution.

```
H(p, q) = - Î£ p(x) * log(q(x))

x iterates over all possible outcomes.
p(x): The true probability of outcome x.
q(x): The predicted probability of outcome x.
```    

The above metrics are calculated for each feature, which helps to identify the best/most important feature.

Advantage of Decision Tree | Disadvantage of Decision Tree
:--- | :---
Handle categorical and numerical data | Prone to overfitting
No effect of outliers | Need careful **parameter tuning**
Handle **non linear data** |

### Individual trees are prone to overfitting but improve when ensembled

### How to Avoid Overfitting?
- Remove | Prune features with less importance (Low IG, high GI, and high Entrophy) (Irrelevant Feature)
- Early stop (Limit the max_depth of the tree)

<h3 name='forest'>4. Random Forests (Ensemble Learning Technique | Bagging)</h3>

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/09.Random%20Forest.ipynb)

- Random sampling (Bootstrap aggregation with replacement)
- An ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees for both regression and classification.
- Ensemble learning algorithms combine the predictions of multiple decision trees to produce a more accurate prediction.
- Once the decision trees (weak learners) are trained, they are used to predict new data points.
- Each decision tree is built using a random subset of the training data (feature matrix)
- Multiple decision trees (weak learners) are trained in parallel and individually/independently.
- Bootstrapping (Row sampling with replacement): Subsets are randomly selected from the original dataset.
- Majority Voting: Prediction of the model is based on the **voting** of decision tree outputs.
- Regression: The mean/average of the predictions of all the decision trees are considered.
- Classification: The class selected by most of the decision trees is considered.
- Random forest creates a model that is more accurate and less prone to overfitting than a single decision tree.
- **Bagging:** Multiple decision trees are trained in parallel to form one strong accurate predicting model.
- Adding multiple decision trees reduces the risk of error and overfitting by reducing the variance.
- Random forests are accurate, robust to overfitting, and used for both regression and classification.
- Random forests can be trained on data of any type (numerical, categorical, and ordinal data)
- Random forest provides an attribute **model.feature_importances_** that retrieves the relative importance scores for each input feature.
- Anyhow each Decision Tree uses Gini Index, Entropy, and Information Gain which find the best features from the dataset.

**Advantages:**
- RF can handle large datasets with high features and can provide accurate results.
- RF can handle non-linear relationships between features and target variables.
- RF can handle missing values in the data.
- RF performs feature selection by building multiple decision trees.
- Each tree is built using a random selection of features and observations from the dataset.
- Feature sampling ensures that different trees in the random forest use different subsets of features during training.
- This allows the RF to capture a wider range of patterns and relationships within the data.
- Each tree in the random forest can calculate the importance of a feature (feature_importances_)
- A feature with high IG, low GI and low entropy is an important feature for the model.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
```

<h3 name='adaboost'>ADABOOST (Adaptive Boosting)</h3>

- AdaBoost iteratively trains a sequence of weak decision trees.
- Gives more weight to the data points that are misclassified in each iteration.
- AdaBoost can significantly enhance the accuracy of models, especially when dealing with complex datasets.
- AdaBoost is effective in handling class imbalance and doesn't require extensive hyperparameter tuning.
- AdaBoost implicitly performs feature selection by assigning more importance/weights to relevant features.
- Primarily used for classification tasks. Not well suited for regression tasks.

<h3 name='gbm'>GBM (Gradient Boosting Method)</h3>

- Gradient boosting combines the ideas of boosting (combining weak learners to create a strong learner) with gradient descent.
- A method used to minimize errors in predictions. It's primarily used in regression and classification problems.
- Loss function: Measures how far the model's predictions are from the actual values.
- Gradient boosting algorithms aim to minimize this loss function.
- Gradient Descent: An iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function.

Algorithm Steps:
- **Initialize with a base model:** Starts with a simple model (decision tree) to make initial predictions.
- **Compute the Residuals:** Calculate the difference between predicted and actual values (residuals)
- **Build a New Model:** Construct a new model to predict the residuals from the previous model.
- **Update the Model:** Update the model's predictions by adding the new model's predictions to the previous predictions.
- **Minimize Loss Function:** Use gradient descent to find the model that minimizes the loss function.
- Repeat the process for a specified number of iterations, until the loss function stops decreasing.

<h3 name='xgboost'>XGBOOST (Extreme Gradient Boosting)</h3>

- An advanced implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm.
- It is scalable and highly efficient and is used for its speed and performance.
- XGBoost improves upon the traditional gradient boosting method.
- XGBoost optimizes the computational process and adds enhancements like regularization.
- Efficiently handles a large number of features and large-scale datasets.
- Works well for both regression and classification problems.
- Regularization features help in reducing overfitting, often leading to better accuracy.
- Automatically handles missing values, reducing the need for extensive data preprocessing.
- Can be more complex and challenging to tune.
- If not properly regularized or if trained for too many iterations, it can overfit the training data.

<h3 name='svm'>5. Support Vector Machine | SVM</h3>

- Aims to find an optimal hyperplane that classifies the distinct classes with maximum margin in N-dimensional space.
- Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help to classify the data points. Data points are called Support Vectors.
- SVM can be used for linear and non-linear regression and classification.
- SVM can manage high dimensional data and nonlinear relationships between the data points.
- SVM uses kernel trick for non-linear data which creates a kernel matrix in N-dimensional space for linear separation.
- Works better even if the data set has a lot of outliers (Because SVM focus only on support vectors closest to the hyperplane)
- Take a long time to train and predict if the number of observations is very large.
- Kernel functions: Linear | Radial basis function ( RBF ) | Polynomial | Exponential.

### Benefits 

- SVM works well with unstructured and semi-structured data (text, image, face, anomaly detections, etc.)
- Generalize well on the new unseen data and the risk of overfitting is also less.

### Disadvantage

- Choosing a good Kernel function, fine-tuning and even visualization is challenging due to high dimensionality.
- Feature rescaling (normalization/standardization) is very important for better accuracy.
- Not suitable for larger datasets, training can be time and resource-consuming.
- Difficult to understand and interpret the final model, variable weights have individual impact.

<h3 name='knn'>6. K Nearest Neighbours</h3>

- KNN is used for both regression and classification. Measures the Euclidean distance between the data points. 
- Initialize K (# nearest neighbours) we need for comparison or calculation.
- Calculate the distance between new data points and the K nearest neighbours of training data points.
- e.g. if K = 5, it will calculate the distance from the 5 nearest data points.
- Sort the calculated distance in ascending order and get the shortest distance or most frequent classes in neighbour.
- Regression: Mean of K nearest distances are considered.
- Classification: Mode of K nearest distances are considered.

<h3 name='naive'>7. Naive Bayes</h3>

- Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier, based on class prediction probability (Binary and Multiclass classification)
- Creates the conditional probability distribution for all the classes independently.
- Naive: Assumes that all of the features are independent of each other (No correlation between any feature)
- e.g Classification of dog breed (Naive Bayes tries to create a probability that each dog belongs to a separate class)
- Weights can be added to improve accuracy.
- Fast, highly scalable, requires less training, and can be used for real-time predictions.
- Can handle missing data and is not sensitive to irrelevant features.
- P(Class | Data) = (P(Data | Class) * P(Class)) / P(Data)
- P(Class | Data): Probability after observing the data (Posterior Probability)
- P(Data | Class): Likelihood
- P(Class): Probability before observing the data (Prior Probability)
- Classification: Spam email, Dogs Breed Image, and Customer likely to churn.
- Regression: House price, Product Sales, and Customer lifeline.
- Anomaly detection: Detecting fraudulent transactions, Network intrusion, and Outlier detection.

 <h1 name='cluster' align=center>Clustering</h1>

- Find relationships and patterns between independent features.
- Extract important features and explore the dataset in detail.
- Groups the data points into segments or clusters based on similarity.
- Unsupervised algorithms don't make predictions from the data.

### **Clustering Techniques**

<h3 name='kmean'><strong>1. K Mean Clustering</strong></h3>

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/10.K%20Mean%20Clustering.ipynb)

- An unsupervised ML algorithm to group similar data points into K distinct clusters.
- Data points with similar characteristics are grouped in one cluster.
- Mean in K-Mean refers to the averaging of data (Finding the centroid by calculating mean)
- Decide how many clusters you want to form in your data. 
- K random data points are initially selected as a centroid (centre of cluster) for each cluster.
- Each data point nearest to its corresponding centroid belongs/assigned to that cluster.
- The centroid is recalculated for the newly formed clusters, and the data points are updated based on the new centroid.
- This is an iterative process, we stop when there is no further classification.
- Different starting points (centroid) create different clusters. 

### **Elbow Method**
- The sum of the squared distance between the data point and centroid gets smaller as the number of clusters increases.
- The **Elbow Method** helps us to find the optimal number of clusters.

**Usage:**
1. **Market Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on purchasing behaviour, age, income, etc.
2. **Document Classification:** Grouping documents by topics, subject, or contents.
3. **Image Compression:** Reducing the number of colours in an image.
4. **Spatial Data Analysis:** Identifying areas of similar land use in an urban setting.
5. **Anomaly Detection:** Detecting unusual patterns or outliers in datasets.

<h3 name='hc'><strong>2. Hierarchical Clustering</strong></h3>

- Groups data points into a hierarchy of clusters. We don't need to determine the number of clusters.
- A dendrogram can visualize and determine the number of clusters in the data.

### Agglomerative Nesting (Bottom-Up Approach)
- Treating each data point as a single cluster and then merging the closest data points.
- After each iteration, similar and closest clusters are merged, until there is only one cluster left.

### Divise Analysis (Top-Down Approach)
- Starts with considering all the data points in a single cluster
- Iteratively splits the clusters based on dissimilarity.

### How do we calculate the similarity between the clusters?
- **MIN:** Distance between the closest data points of two clusters.
- **MAX:** Distance between the farthest data points of two clusters.
- **AVG:** Average distance between each data point of two clusters.
- **Centroids:** Distance between the centroid of two clusters.
 
<h3 name="dbscan"><strong>3. Density Based Clustering</strong></h3>

- **DBSCAN:** Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (outliers).
- Group similar data points together based on density (data points that are closely packed together).
- **High-Density Region:** Data points are close to each other | High neighbours within the radius.
- Unlike other clustering algorithms, DBSCAN does not require a predefined number of clusters.
- Data points in low-density regions are outliers.
- Visualization (Scatter Plot or Density Plot) can explain the clustering method in a better way.
- DBSCAN can effectively identify clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes.

DBSCAN defines 3 types of data points based on their density.
1. **Core points:** Data points that are very close to each other.
2. **Border points:** Data points that are neighbours but not too close to each other.
3. **Noise points:** Data points that are very far away from the rest of the data points (Outliers)

### **B. Dimensionality Reduction**

- A technique used to reduce the number of features/variables in a dataset while retaining the most important information.
- Simplifying the complexity of the dataset by reducing the number of dimensions (variables) without losing information.
- The aim is to find the **important features/variables** that the model can use for better prediction.
- Reducing **irrelevant features** that have no relation with the target feature.
- Reduces **multicollinearity**, and saves storage and time by improving the performance of the model.
- Project data into lower dimensions while preserving as much useful variability (19/20) as possible.
- e.g. If we observe a Scatter Plot in multi-dimension it will be complicated for understanding. 
- Consider only 1D then it is just a line and a few points in which some are close to the line and some are a bit far away from the line.
- Combine features or remove features to reduce dimensions.
- Dimensionality Reduction helps to prevent the models from overfitting (Due to too many features)
- Simplifies the model, improves accuracy, fast training, easy visualization, and helps to identify patterns easily.
- Scale and normalize data before applying dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Use visualizations to assess how well the reduced dimensions represent the data.

### **Techniques of Dimensionality Reduction**

<h3 name='pca'>Principal Component Analysis (PCA | Unsupervised | Numerical)</h3> 

[Algorithm](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Algorithms/blob/main/Code/11.PCA.ipynb)

- Transforms a dataset into a new set of features without losing information called principal components.
- A dataset with high dimensions and high correlation can be complicated for analysis and visualization.
- PCA aims to capture the most important features in the dataset while reducing its dimensionality.
- Datasets with essential features are easy to explore, visualize, analyze and train (simplifies the EDA).
- The first principal component (PC1) explains the largest amount of variation in the dataset.
- Subsequent principal components (PCs) explain the decreasing amount of variations in the dataset.
- PCA tries to put the maximum possible information in the first principle component. 
- And then tries to put the remaining information in the corresponding principle components.
- PCA is affected by the scale, so rescaling features before applying PCA is important.

<h3 name='lda'><strong>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA | Supervised | Categorical | Classification)</strong></h3>

- LDA identifies the best way to separate the existing categories/classes in the dataset.  
- Finds the best linear separation to classify datasets into different categories/classes.
- Reduce the number of features and maximize the separation between two or more categories/classes.
- LDA creates a new axis (Maximize the distance between means of two classes and minimize variation within each class)

<h3 name='tsne'>t-SNE (t Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding | Non-linear)</h3>

- Used to visualize high dimensional data in a low dimensional space.
- Non-linear dimensionality reduction technique (spiral, mixed) 
- t-SNE calculates the probability that a data point is a neighbour of another data point in the higher dimensional space.
- t-SNE then constructs a similar joint probability distribution in the lower dimensional space.
- Identity clusters based on the similarity of data points.
- Reduces dimensions while keeping similar instances closer and dissimilar instances apart.

### Anomaly Detection
- Discover unusual data points and abnormal relationships and patterns in the dataset.
- Used to find fraudulent transactions and identify an outlier caused by human error during data entry.
- Reduces complexity of data and helps to understand data in a better way.

### Association Mining
- Set of items that frequently occur together in a dataset.
- **Basket Analysis:** Items bought together | Goods purchased simultaneously help develop marketing strategies.

### Apriori
- A widely used algorithm in **data mining**, specifically for **association rule learning**.
- It helps identify relationships between items that frequently appear together in transactions.

### Reinforcement Learning
- ML technique that enables an agent to learn and interact with an environment by trial and error.
- RL uses rewards and punishments to address and signals for positive and negative behaviour.
- RL agents learn from the consequences of their actions.

**Key Components of RL**
1. **Agent:** The entity that learns and interacts with the environment.
2. **Environment:** The surrounding world that the agent interacts with.
3. **State:** The current situation of the agent within the environment.
4. **Action:** The choices the agent can make.
5. **Reward:** A signal indicating how well the agent performed in a given state.
