# Object Oriented Programming

- `Analysis` : Understand your **problem** ( **What** do you need to do ? )
- `Design` : Plan your **solution** ( **How** are you going to do it ? )
- `Programming` : **Build** it.

### Approach

- Gather requirements.
- Describe the Application.
- Identify the main object.
- Describe the interactions.
- Create a class diagram.

Structuring a program by bundling related `properties` or `attributes` and `behaviors` into individual `objects`

### Procedural Programming
- Structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of **functions** and **code blocks**, that flow sequentially in order to complete task.

### Class
- `Blueprint` or `template` that describes `attributes` and `method` of an object.
- `Attributes` : Physical properties.
- `Method` : Behavior or action.

Define a `class`

``` Python
class Student:
    pass
```

### `Object`
- `Instance` of a `class` which has `attributes` and `methods`
- When class is defined, only the `description` for an object is defined, no `memory` or `storage` is allocated.

**Characteristics** of `objects` of class :

1. Identity ( What is it ? : class Person ) 
2. Attributes | Properties | Characteristics | Data ( What Describes it ? : Name, Gender, Age, Height, Weight )
3. Behaviour | Action | Operation ( What can it do ? : Read, Write, Walk, Run, Study, Teach )

The concept of `OOP` in focuses on creating **reusable** code | `DRY` ( Don't Repeat Yourself )

### Constructor 
- Automatically invokes whenever an object is created.
- `Default Constructor` : Constructor with `no` parameters | arguments..

### `__init__()`

- Like a constructor method (**Initialize** an **object**)
- Everytime a new object is created, `__init__()` sets the **initial state** of the object.
- Method is called when any new `instance` of an `object`  is created.
- Initialize the `attributes` of the `class`
- You can give any number of `parameters`
- First parameter will always be a variable `self`

### `self`
- Instance methods can `access` attributes and other methods on the same objects.

``` Python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

``` Python
class Student:

    # Class Attribute (Common Attribute for all Class Instances)
    school_name = "IES GNV"
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```



### `APIE`

- `A` : Abstraction 
- `P` : Polymorphism
- `I` : Inheritance
- `E` : Encapsulation

### `Base` or `Parent` or `Super` class.

### `Derived` or `Child` or `Sub` class.

### `Abstraction`



### `Polymorphism` (Many Forms)


### `Inheritance`





### `Encapsulation`
