# Object Oriented Programming

You are surrounded with **Objects** (Laptop, Mobile, Dog, Person, Book)

> Every **Real World Entity** is an **Object**.

### Class

- A **Template** | **Blueprint** for real world entities.
- A **User defined** data type.

Every class has three components
1. Identity : Unique **Name** to Identify that Object.
2. Properties : Attributes | Data (About the Object)
3. Behavior : Action | Method | Operation (What the Object can do?)

### Object 

- Specific **Instance** of Class
- e.g. If Smartphone is a **Class** then Apple, Samsung, Motorola, Oneplus are instances.
