# `Python`

`Guido Van Rossum`

`PEP 8` : `Python Enhancement Proposal` Guidelines and best practices for writing clean `Python code`

1. Easy to `read`, `write` ( `Code` ) and `learn`
2. `High level interpreted` programming language ( Similar to plain english | Executes codes line by line)
3. `Object oriented`: Creates an object that holds the value and data type, the memory address is passed to the variable. 
4. `Dynamically` typed ( `Data type` of object is based on its `assigned value` | Object can change its data type dynamically )
5. Abundance of `libraries` ( Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, etc. ) and `frameworks` ( Django, Flask, etc. )
6. `Portable` and `flexible` ( Anaconda, Jupyter, Command Prompt, Terminal, IDE, Text Editor, Google Colab )
7. `Open source` with vibrant `community` support ( Stack Overflow, Videos, Medium, etc. )
8. Rich `documentation` ( Python as well as all the libraries i.e. builtin as well as 3rd party modules and submodules )
9. `Modularity`: Working in seperate `modules`, helps to **focus** and make development easy and less error prone.
10. `Reusability` of codes, `modules`, `functions`, `methods` and `classes` can be easily reused by other part of the program.
11. `Applications`: Statistics, Data Science, ML, DL, AI, IOT, Web Development, Analytics, System Admin, Automations, etc.
12. The only drawback is execution speed is `low` as compared to `C`, `C++`, etc.

<h3 align="center">Interpreter vs Compiler</h3>

<table align="center">
        <tr>
                <th>Interpreter</th>
                <th>Compiler</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>Takes a single code of line at a time</td>
                <td>Translate entire program into an intermediate machine code</td>
        </tr>      
        <tr>
                <td>Never generates any intermediate machine code</td>
                <td>Generates an intermediate machine code</td>
        </tr>    
        <tr>
                <td>Good for software development environment</td>
                <td>Good for production environment</td>
        </tr>    
        <tr>
                <td>Error detection is easy</td>
                <td>Error detection is not easy</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>Python and Ruby</td>
                <td>C, C++, C# and Java</td>
        </tr>
</table>      

<h3 align="center">Pickling vs Unpickling</h3>

<table align="center">
        <tr>
                <th>Pickling</th>
                <th>Unpickling</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>Serialization : Convert object into byte streams or binary file</td>
                <td>Deserialization : Convert byte streams or binary file into object</td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
                <td>Serialize into format that can be stored</td>
                <td>Deserialize stored byte stream and load the object into memory</td>

         <tr>

                <td>pickle.load( )</td>
        </tr>   
</table>      

<h3 align="center">Protected vs Private</h3>

<table align="center">
        <tr>
                <th>Protected</th>
                <th>Private</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>Attributes or Methods defined with single underscore ( _name )</td>
                <td>Attributes or Methods defined with double underscore ( __name )</td>
        </tr>      
         <tr>
                <td>Can be accessed and modified from outside the Class</td>
                <td>Cannot be accessed and modified from outside directly</td>
        </tr>               
</table>

### `Function`
- A piece of `code`, capable of performing a similar task repeatedly.
- Function is defined using `def` keyword.

```python
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2,...):
    pass
    return value
```

### `Python Memory Management`
- Python manages its memory using private `heap space`
- `Objects` are stored in `heap` ( Inaccessible to the programmers )
- In built `garbage collector` to `recycle` the unused memory for the `private heap space`

### `break`
- `Terminates` the `loop` and control flows to the statement after the body of loop.

### `continue`
- `Terminates` current iteration of the statement, `skips` the rest of the code in current iteration
- Control flows to the next iteration of the Loop.

### `pass`
- Empty statement just used to bypass the error situation.

### `Generators`
- Functions that returns an `iterable collection` of items on which we can apply loop or control flow.

### `help()`
- Display `documentation` of `modules`, `classes`, `functions` and `keywords`

### `dir()`
- List of valid `attributes` and `methods` of an object based on its datatype and state.

### `Define Function`

``` Python
def functionname(argument1, argument2):
    pass
```        

### `Call Function`

```Python
functionname(parameter1, parameter2)
```

### Position of Arguments

```Python
def example(arg_1, arg_2, *args, **kwargs):
```
